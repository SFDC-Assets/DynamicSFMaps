<h1 align="center">Dynamic SF Maps</h1>
<p align="center">This package contains apex classes to dynamically render the locations of different records returned by a SOQL query into Salesforce Maps.  The premise of this component is based off of <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000354507&type=1">this Salesforce Maps documentation</a> which details how to pass records into a custom URL that will render a list of records in a custom layer on the Map. </p>

## Summary

This component was originally designed for the Organization Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE) program for the U.S. Army.  The goal of this component was to render all of the warehouse locations that contained the requested order line items onto a dynamically created Salesforce Maps layer.  From the simple push of a button on the order form, users would be automatically redirected to a view of Salesforce Maps that displays all of the locations that contained the requested items.
